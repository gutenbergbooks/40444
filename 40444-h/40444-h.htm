<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the mind of man is ever fond of variety,
nothing seems better calculated to entertain,
than a judicious collection of the smaller, though
not on that account less laboured, productions of
eminent poets: an entertainment, not unlike that
which we receive from surveying a finished landschape,
or well disposed piece of shell-work: where
each particular object, tho' singly beautiful, and
sufficiently striking by itself, receives an additional
charm, thus, as Milton expresses it, <span class="smcap">sweetly
interchanged</span>.</p>

<p>The first miscellaneous collection of poems, that
ever appeared in Great-Britain with any reputation,
is that published by Dryden: which was afterwards
continued by Tonson. There are many pieces of
the highest merit in this collection, by Dryden,
Denham, Creech, Drayton, Garth, Marvell, and
many others; yet the compilers, it is evident, were
not always sufficiently scrupulous and cautious in
their choice, as several pieces are admitted, among
the rest, which would otherwise utterly have perished,
and which had no other recommendation,
than that they served to swell the volume. Since
this, many miscellanies have been published both
in Scotland and England: to enumerate which
would be no less tedious than useless. It will be
sufficient to remark, that through want of care or
judgment in their respective editors, they are all
forgotten or neglected. From these the miscellany
known by the name of Mr. Pope perhaps ought
to be excepted; tho' that, indeed, cannot properly
be styled a collection of poems by different
hands, which is such a one as we are speaking of
at present, the greater part consisting of pieces by
Mr. Pope only. The best miscellany at this day
extant in our language, and the first complete one
of the kind which we have seen, is that lately published
by R. Dodsley, which boasts the greatest
names of the present age among its contributors.</p>

<p>As to the poetical collection here exhibited to
the public, we apprehend it challenges no small
degree of regard, as it was made under the immediate
inspection and conduct of several very ingenious
gentlemen, whose names it would do us the
highest honour to mention; and as it contains a
variety not to be found even in the admirable collection
last spoken of; I mean the Intermixture of
poems both Scotch and English. Nor is this variety
less agreeable than useful; as from it we have
an opportunity of forming a comparison and estimate
of the taste and genius of the two different
nations, in their poetical compositions.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to take notice, that our chief
care has been to furnish out the following miscellany
with those pieces, regard being first had to real
merit, which have laid unknown and unobserved
from their <span class="smcap">manner</span> of publication; several of them
having been printed by themselves, and so perished
as it were for want of bulk, and others lost
amid the rubbish of collections injudiciously made,
and perhaps not easily to be met with. Nor will
it be improper to mention, that in order to render
our volume still more compleat, we have had the
favour of some original poems, written by a late
member of the university of Aberdeen, whose modesty
would not permit us to prefix his name: one
of which in this edition is printed with many improvements,
from a corrected copy. And from
these ingenious essays, the public may be enabled
to form some judgment beforehand of a poem of a
nobler and more important nature, which he is
now preparing. Nor must we forget to return our
public thanks to this gentleman, for the service he
has been to us, not only in making this collection
more excellent by his own contributions, but in selecting
such pieces of others as were suitable to
our design.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the ancient Scottish poems (amongst
which <span class="smcap">the thistle and the rose</span>, and
<span class="smcap">hardyknute</span> are more particularly distinguished)
will make no disagreeable figure amongst those of
modern date; and that they will produce the same
effect here, as Mr. Pope observes a moderate use of
old words may have in a poem; which, adds he,
is like working old abbey-stones into a modern
building, and which I have sometimes seen practised
with good success.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, as we have been favoured with
the best assistance in compiling this volume, no further
apology is necessary; and as the approbation
of the public has been already secured to these poems
separately, we hope they have no less reason to
claim it, when thus published together.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oblivion wraps not in her silent shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All human labours. Virtue blooms a flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Time's rough hand shall never violate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still CAROLINE shall live in faithful verse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet nurse of Memory, and in the voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of grateful Britain. These shall testify<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How well her calm impartial rule supplied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A monarch's absence; these commemorate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her soul contemplative of peaceful Truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nature, mindful midst the pomp of Courts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wise retirement, and the silent grove.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She stretch'd thro' length'ning shades thy spacious walks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delightful Richmond, and the terrass rais'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of regal grandeur, whence the eye discerns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair Thames with copious waters winding slow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Midst pastures, spreading herds, and villages<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of aspect neat, and villas wrapt in shades:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair scene of chearful peace! the lovely sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frequent she view'd, and bless'd the honour'd reign<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of her great Consort, provident and mild.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now wander'd musing thro' the darkening depth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thickest woods, friendly to solemn thought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now o'er broad lawns fair opening to the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor midst her rural plans disdain'd to mix<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The useful arable, and waving corn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With soft turf border'd, and the lowly cot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That half appears, in branching elms obscur'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here beauty dwells, assembled from the scenes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of various nature; such as oft inflam'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rapture Grecian bards, in that fair vale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thessalian Tempe, or thy favorite soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arcadia, erst by awe-struck fancy fill'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wand'ring forms, the woodland Deities,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light Nymphs and wanton Satyrs, faintly seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick glancing thro' the shade at close of eve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Pan, and old Silenus. Hither led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By solitary grief shall GEORGE recall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' endearing manners, the soft speech, that flow'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his lov'd Consort, virtue mix'd with love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prudence, and mild insinuating sense:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But chief her thoughtful breast of counsels deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Capacious, nor unequal to the weight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Government. Such was the royal mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wise ELIZA, name of loveliest sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To British ears, and pattern fair to Kings:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or she who rules the Scepter of the North<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Illustrious, spreading o'er a barbarous world<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The light of arts and manners, and with arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Infests th' astonish'd Sultan, hardly now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With scatter'd troops resisting; she drives on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heavy war, and shakes th' Imperial Throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of old Byzantium. Latest time shall sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The praise of female genius. Oft shall GEORGE<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pay the kind tear, and grief of tender words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To CAROLINE, thus oft lamenting sad.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Hail sacred shade! by me with endless woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Still honour'd! ever in my Breast shall dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thy image, ever present to my soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thy faithful love, in length of years mature:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O skill'd t'enliven time, to soften care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"With looks and smiles and friendship's chearful voice!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Anxious, of Thee bereft, a solitude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I feel, that not the fond condoling cares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Of our sad offspring can remove. Ev'n now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"With lonely steps I trace the gloomy groves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thy lov'd recesses, studious to recall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The vanish'd bliss, and cheat my wand'ring thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"With sweet illusion. Yet I not accuse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Heav'n's dispensation. Prosperous and long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Have been my days, and not unknown to fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That dwells with virtue. But 'tis hard to part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The league of ancient friendship, to resign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The home-felt fondness, the secure delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That reason nourish'd, and fair fame approv'd."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As Xanthus delug'd in the cause of Troy.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some unknown channel lend, where Nature spreads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inglorious vales, and unfrequented meads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, where a hind scarce tunes his rustic strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where scarce a pilgrim treads the pathless plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Content I'll flow; forget that e'er my tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw yon majestic structures crown it's side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forget, that e'er my rapt attention hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or on the Sage's or the Poet's tongue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calm and resign'd my humbler lot embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pleas'd, prefer oblivion to disgrace.<br /></span>

<span class="i4">On closing flow'rs when genial gales diffuse<br /></span>

<span class="i4">When chaunts the milk-maid at her balmy pail,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And weary reapers whistle o'er the vale;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Charm'd by the murmurs of the quiv'ring shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">O'er ISIS' willow-fringed banks I stray'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And calmly musing thro' the twilight way,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In pensive mood I fram'd the Doric lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">When lo! from op'ning clouds, a golden gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Pour'd sudden splendors o'er the shadowy stream;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And from the wave arose it's guardian queen,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
<span class="i4">Known by her sweeping stole of glossy green;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">While in the coral crown that bound her brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Was wove the Delphic laurel's verdant bough.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">As the smooth surface of the dimply flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The silver-slipper'd ISIS lightly trod,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">From her loose hair the dropping dew she press'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And thus mine ear in accents mild address'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">No more, my son, the rural reed employ,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Nor trill the trifling strain of empty joy;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">No more thy love-resounding sonnets suit<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To notes of pastoral pipe or oaten flute.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For hark! high-thron'd on yon majestic walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To the dear Muse afflicted Freedom calls:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">When Freedom calls, and <span class="smcap">oxford</span> bids thee sing,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">While thus, in Freedom's and in Ph&#339;bus' spite,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">For tinsel'd courts their laurel'd mount despise,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In stars and strings superlatively wise:<br /></span>

<span class="i4">And snatch a gift beyond the reach of kings.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Scorning, and scorn'd by courts, yon Muses' bow'r<br /></span>

<span class="i4">"These destin'd feats be mine" exulting cries;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">On ISIS still each gift of fortune waits,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Still peace and plenty deck my beauteous gates.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">See Science walks with freshest chaplets crown'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With songs of joy my festal groves resound;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">My muse divine, still keeps her wonted state,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The front erect, and high majestic gait:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Green as of old, each oliv'd portal smiles,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And still the graces build my Parian piles:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">My Gothic spires in ancient grandeur rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And dare with wonted pride to rush into the skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Ah should'st thou fall (forbid it heav'nly pow'rs!)<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Dash'd into dust with all thy cloud-capt tow'rs;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who but would mourn to British virtue dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">What patriot could refuse the manly tear!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">What British <span class="smcap">marius</span> could refrain to weep<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Beneath its Attic roofs receiv'd the Nine;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Mute was the voice of joy and loud applause,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To <span class="smcap">radcliffe</span> due, and ISIS' honour'd cause?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">What free-born crouds adorn'd the festive day,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
<span class="i4">Nor blush'd to wear my tributary bay!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">How each brave breast with honest ardors heav'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">When <span class="smcap">sheldon's</span> fane the patriot band receiv'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">While, as we loudly hail'd the chosen few,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Rome's awful senate rush'd upon our view!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">O may the day in latest annals shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That made a <span class="smcap">beaufort</span>, and an <span class="smcap">harley</span> mine:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then bade them leave the loftier scene awhile,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">To hold short dalliance with the tuneful Nine.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then Music left her golden sphere on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And bore each strain of triumph from the sky;<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Pour'd the full Pæans of mellifluous sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">My Naiads blythe the floating accents caught,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And list'ning danc'd beneath their pearly grot:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In gentler eddies play'd my wanton wave,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Each lay with brighter green adorn'd my bow'rs,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And breath'd a fresher fragrance on my flow'rs.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">But lo! at once the swelling concerts cease,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And crouded theatres are hush'd in peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">See, on yon sage how all attentive stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To catch his darting eye, and waving hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Hark! he begins, with all a <span class="smcap">tully's</span> art<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To pour the dictates of a <span class="smcap">cato's</span> heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Skill'd to pronounce what noblest thoughts inspire,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
<span class="i4">He blends the speaker's with the patriot's fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Bold to conceive, nor tim'rous to conceal,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">What Britons dare to think, he dares to tell.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">'Tis his alike the ear and eye to charm,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To win with action, and with sense to warm;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Untaught in flow'ry diction to dispense<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The lulling sounds of sweet impertinence;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In frowns or smiles he gains an equal prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Nor meanly fears to fall, nor creeps to rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Bids happier days to <span class="smcap">albion</span> be restor'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Bids ancient Justice rear her radiant sword;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">From me, as from my country, wins applause,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And makes an <span class="smcap">oxford's</span> a <span class="smcap">britannia's</span> cause.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">While arms like these my steadfast sages wield,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Say, shall I foster this domestic pest,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">This parricide that wounds a mother's breast?<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Thus in the stately ship that long has bore<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Britain's victorious cross from shore to shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">By chance, beneath her close sequester'd cells,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Eats his blind way, and saps with secret toil<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The deep foundations of the watry pile.<br /></span>

<span class="i4">More sure the reptile's little arts devour,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor slept those thoughts, whene'er in other climes<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of helpless sorrow, solemn sad accounts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How fair <span class="smcap">augusta</span> watch'd the weary night<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How heav'd the orphan's and the widow's sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That follow'd <span class="smcap">frederic</span> to the silent tomb.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For well was <span class="smcap">frederic</span> lov'd; and well deserv'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His voice was ever sweet, and on his steps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attended ever the alluring grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gentle lowliness and social zeal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him shall remember oft the labour'd hind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And treads at last the wish'd-for beach, shall stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appall'd at the sad tale, and soon shall steal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down his rough cheek th' involuntary tear.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Be this our solace yet, all is not dead;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Those hallowed spires, whose gloomy vaults enclose,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then shall his generous breast be new inflam'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To acts of highest worth, and highest fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These plaintive strains from <span class="smcap">albion</span> far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lonely meditate at even-tide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor skill'd nor studious of the raptur'd lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still remembring oft the magic sounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well-measur'd to the chime of Dorian lute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or past'ral stop, which erst I lov'd to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On <span class="smcap">Isis'</span> broider'd mead, where dips by fits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stooping osier in her hasty stream.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hail <span class="smcap">wolsey's</span> spacious dome! hail, ever fam'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For faithful nurture, and truth's sacred lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much honour'd parent! You my duteous zeal<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From shelter deep of shaggy rock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shepherd drives his joyful flock;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In this small work all nature's wonders see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soften'd features of philosophy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In truth by easy steps you here advance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Truth, as diverting as the best romance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long had these arts to sages been confin'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None saw their beauty, till by poring blind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By studying spent, like men that cram too full,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Wisdom's feast they rose not chear'd, but dull:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gay and airy smil'd to see 'em grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fled such wisdom like <span class="smcap">trophonius'</span> cave.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Your flutt'ring sex still valued science less;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Careless of any, but the arts of dress.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their useless time was idly thrown away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On empty novels, or some new-born play.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The best, perhaps, a few loose hours might spare<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With mingling blazes shed a flood of light:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each nymph with cold indiff'rence saw 'em rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, taught by fops, to them preferr'd her eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None thought the stars were suns so widely sown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None dreamt of other worlds, besides our own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well might they boast their charms, when ev'ry fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought this world all, and hers the brightest here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! quit not the large thoughts this book inspires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For those thin trifles which your sex admires;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assert your claim to sense, and shew mankind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That reason is not to themselves confin'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The haughty belle, whose beauty's awful shrine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twere sacrilege t' imagine not divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thought so greatly of her eyes before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bid her read this, and then be vain no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How poor ev'n You, who reign without controul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If we except the beauties of your soul!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should all beholders feel the same surprize;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should all who see you, see you with my eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were no such blasts to make that beauty less;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should you be what I think, what all confess:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis but a narrow space those charms engage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One Island only, and not half an Age.<br /></span>

<p class="centert1b">TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES</p>

<p>Eighteenth-century idiosyncrasies of spelling, punctuation and
capitalisation have been retained.</p>

<p>In the Scottish poems "Prologue to Sir David Lyndesay's Dream" and
"Hardyknute", the letter "z" has been used by the original editor to
represent the letter "&#541;" or "yogh".</p>

<p>The variants "aereal" and "aerial", "All-powerful" and "All-pow'rful",
"far-famd" and "far-fam'd", "noontide" and "noon-tide", "Phebus",
"Phæbus", "Ph&#339;bus" and "Phoebus", "upland" and "up-land", "woodman" and
"wood-man" appear in this text.</p>

<p>The poem "A Love-Elegy, by Mr. Hammond" begins on page 57, not 47 (as
given in the Table of Contents). The incorrect page number has been
retained in the Table of Contents, but a link has been made to the
correct page.</p>

<p>On p. 4 quotation marks are missing after "Queen!" but the text has been
left unchanged.</p>

<p>On p. 69 there should perhaps be closing quotation marks after "print
the ground" and "his father and his God" but the text has been left
unchanged.</p>

<p>On p. 79 the stanza numbering goes from XXI to XXIII in mid-page.</p>

<p>On p. 107 there should perhaps be closing quotation marks after "be but
good!" but the text has been left unchanged.</p>

<p>On p. 115 the line "Is this, he cries, the trumpet's warlike sound?" has
been left unchanged, although quotation marks appear to be missing before
and after "he cries".</p>

<p>On p. 134 closing quotation marks appear to be missing after "commands"
but the text has been left unchanged.</p>

<p>On p. 144 stanza number XXXVIII is incorrectly given as XXXXVIII.</p>

<p class="p2">The following amendments have been made:</p>

<p class="pinset">p. 7: missing hyphen inserted in "Flower-de-lyce";</p>

<p class="pinset">p. 16: "reluctant crouds" amended to "reluctant clouds";</p>

<p class="pinset">p. 64: repeated "shall" deleted in "My sympathizing verse shall flow";</p>

<p class="pinset">p. 95: extra comma removed after "swain";</p>

<p class="pinset">p. 100: "votaties" amended to "votaries";</p>

<p class="pinset">p. 109: after "ESQ" comma changed to full stop;</p>

<p class="pinset">p. 114: "mounts" changed to "mount".</p>
